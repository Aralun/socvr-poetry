Fallen Angel

Feathered angel, cursed above,  
To loose thy flight, condoned to love.  
Snipped the wings of jaded dove.  
Hide behind a mask, a glove.  
Realm alone, words of woe,  
Whims are raped, the fallen foe,  
Return alive, she scarce but know,  
If not be damned to a life of low.  
Trespass naught this tragic night,  
Confounded moon, waxen light  
Ashen curse disturb thy sight,  
To no escape this wicked blight.
