@TimCastelijns I've been thinking. When life gives you a wall of text? 
Don’t edit it. Make life take the wall of text back! Get mad! 
I don’t want your damn posts! What am I supposed to do with these? 
Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought is could give me a wall of text! 
Do you know who I am? I'm the man who’s going to burn your house down! With the wall of text!
 I'm going to get my engineers to invent a combustible wall of text that burns your house down!
