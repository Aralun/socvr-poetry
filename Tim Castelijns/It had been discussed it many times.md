It had been discussed it many times,  
We needed a place to keep all of our rhymes.  
A place we could call our treasure chest.  
So gunr made a start, and Sam did the rest.  
  
The reason for this poem is celibratory.  
It was not the first on this earth,  
but today, we gave birth  
to the SOCVR poetry repository!
