# SOCVR Poetry Archives

Welcome to our poetical archives! Take a seat, get some coffee, and feel free to explore our random babblings. 


It had been discussed it many times,  
We needed a place to keep all of our rhymes.  
A place we could call our treasure chest.  
So gunr made a start, and Sam did the rest. 

The reason for this poem is celibratory.  
It was not the first on this earth,  
but today, we gave birth  
to the SOCVR poetry repository!
